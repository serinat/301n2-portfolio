        <p>Hello! My name is James Wortley, I'm a QA Tester for Amazon and one of my passions involve software development!</p>
        <p>One of my favorite things to try in software development is to try out different libraries and understand how they work. Please see below for some of the libraries I have tested and my brief review of them</p>
        <p>If you would like to get in touch with me, please view my <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-wortley-42077814'>LinkedIn</a>, also please view my current projects at <a href='https://github.com/wortleyjk-codefellows'>GitHub</a>
